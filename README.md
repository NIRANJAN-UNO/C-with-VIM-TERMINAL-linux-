# C-with-VIM-TERMINAL-linux-
This repo is dedicated to my learning journey in the C programming language. I initially practiced using the Vim text editor and the Linux terminal to compile and execute programs. My primary reference is The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie  the classic book written by the creator of C himself, Dennis Ritchie.
