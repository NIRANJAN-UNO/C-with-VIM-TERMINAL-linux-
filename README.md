# C-with-VIM-TERMINAL-linux-
This repo is dedicated to my learning journey in the C programming language. I initially practiced using the Vim text editor and the Linux terminal to compile and execute programs. My primary reference is The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie  the classic book written by the creator of C himself, Dennis Ritchie.

initally I used Vim text editor to write the c program and used terminal to run the program. The file with filname.c is the program file and the file with name <filename> alone is the executable file.
My first program is the simple hello world program and i will be practicing further programming techniques and will be updating the repo with my practice files.

Note: This repo does not contain any specific projects or any kind of other programs just simple to complex program files which i will practice and upload to maintain my progress.
